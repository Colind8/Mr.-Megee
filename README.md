# Mr.-Megee-public
Welcome to the public repository for Mr. Megee. Well you can't call it a repository because the actual repository part is missing, but now you can use all the other features!

## Features
Here you will have access to the following features:
### Issues
Issues are created for "todo" items on the Mr. Megee Development board. You can create an issue yourself to report a bug, suggest a new feature, or anything else.
### Projects
This will link to the Mr. Megee Development Board where you can track what's going on with Mr. Megee
### Wiki
I plan to use this soon
